The remote-helper bridges to access data stored in Mercurial and
Bazaar is maintained outside the git.git tree in the repositories of
its primary author respectively:

    https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg (for Mercurial)
    https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr (for Bazaar)

As a convenience, copies of the last-bundled version of these two
remote-helper bridges are still kept here, but they may go stale.

Users are encouraged to visit the above authoritative repositories
to obtain the latest versions and get involved in its further
developments.
